# saveyourself.media - GitHub Pages Website

The website for all things Save Yourself, whether it's just getting social links or viewing my entire portfolio. View changelog at https://saveyourself.media/changelog

## Currently in Snapshot Testing

At the moment, I'm just working on getting the main website to function and provide details about me along with getting in touch which will become the first official release. In the future, I'm hoping to add more details, maybe a blog, a merch website, nicer animations and even a "Bouncy Castle" full of HTML experiments, weird pages and more.
